# Intro-to-Keras-with-breast-cancer-data-ANN-
This is a small yet useful kernel for providing an introduction to Artificial Neural Networks for people who want to begin their journey into the field of deep learning. For this, I have used Keras which is a high-level Neural Networks API built on top of low level neural networks APIs like Tensorflow and Theano. As it is high-level, many things are already taken care of therefore it is easy to work with and a great tool to start with
